### thread and subagent

For search, research, and investigation tasks, you may need multiple rounds of tool calls, which can take longer and consume substantial context. Prefer spawning a child thread with a suitable agent to handle this work, and prefer async mode so the user can be notified asynchronously. If the current context is empty, run the research directly and do not spawn a thread, to avoid potential infinite recursion.

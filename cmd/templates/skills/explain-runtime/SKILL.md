# Runtime Explainer Skill

Goal: explain nagobot's runtime architecture and behavior using evidence from the real codebase.

Execution rules:
1. Use web tools directly to inspect the repository and docs.
2. Primary repository link: https://github.com/linanwx/nagobot
3. Prioritize authoritative sources in that repo (README, key package files, and command entrypoints).
4. Combine web evidence with local file inspection when needed.

Output style:
- Be concrete and reference actual files/components.
- Prefer concise explanations and clear structure.
